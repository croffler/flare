<h1 id="how-space-object-id-is-generated">How Space Object ID is Generated?</h1>

<p>You can insert an object into the space using the <code>Write()</code> and <code>WriteMultiple()</code> methods. When a new object is inserted into the space, it embeds a unique ID - called the UID. The UID can be generated explicitly by the client using a unique value generated by the application business logic or using a sequencer running within the space.</p>

<p>The space UID for space object can be created in three different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>When a space object has no <code>SpaceId</code> property declared, the space generates a UID for the object.</li>
<li>When a space object has a property which is declared as <code>SpaceId</code> and marked as <code>auto-generate=false</code>, the UID is generated based on the value of the ID field the user is setting.</li>
<li>When a space object has a property which is declared as <code>SpaceId</code> and marked as <code>auto-generate=true</code>, the UID is generated by the space and placed back into the field using the relevant setter method. In this case, the field must be a <code>String</code> type.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-spaceid-field-content">The SpaceId Field content</h1>

<ul>
<li>When a space Class has no <code>SpaceId</code> property declared, it will be returned without any ID. This means that <strong>update operations cannot be executed</strong> on the space Class. Only the <code>Read()</code> and <code>Write()</code> methods can be executed.</li>
<li>When a space Class has a property which is declared as <code>SpaceId</code> and <code>auto-generate=true</code> and its value is <code>null</code>, the <code>SpaceId</code> field will store the ID.</li>
<li>When a space Class has a property which is declared as <code>SpaceId</code> and <code>auto-generate=true</code> and its value is not null, the <code>SpaceId</code> field will store the original value stored within the <code>SpaceId</code> field.</li>
<li>When a space Class has a property which is declared as <code>SpaceId</code> and <code>auto-generate=false</code>, the <code>SpaceId</code> field will store the original value stored within the <code>SpaceId</code> field used to generate the UID.</li>
</ul>
