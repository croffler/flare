<h1 >JPA Relationships</h1>
<hr>


<p>The XAP JPA relationships model is different than Relational Databases model. In GigaSpaces relationships are owned, which means that an owner of a relationship holds the owned entities within itself in Space. For instance, if an Author has a One-to-many relationship with Book, in Space all the Book instances relevant for a specific Author will reside
within a Collection in Author.</p>

<p>When defining a One-to-one/One-to-many relationship the cascading type should be set to CascadeType.ALL using the relationship&rsquo;s annotation cascade attribute since no-cascading is unsupported.
Setting cascading globally can also be done in orm.xml:</p>

<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;persistence-unit-metadata&gt;
&lt;persistence-unit-defaults&gt;
&lt;cascade-persist/&gt;
&lt;/persistence-unit-defaults&gt;
&lt;/persistence-unit-metadata&gt;
</code></pre>

</div> 

<h1 id="embedded">Embedded</h1>

<p>In the following example we have a Store entity which has an embedded Address property.
In this case, the Address property is saved as is within Store.</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">// An Embeddable Address object
@Embeddable
public class Address implements Serializable {
private String street;
private String city;
private String country;

public Address() {
}

public String getStreet() {
return this.street;
}

public String getCity() {
return this.city;
}

public String getCountry() {
return this.country;
}

/* Additional Getters &amp; Setters */

}

// A Store entity with an embedded Address property
@Entity
public class Store {
private Integer id;
private Address address;

public Store() {
}

@Id
@SpaceId
public Integer getId() {
return this.id;
}

@Embedded
@SpaceIndex(path = &quot;city&quot;) // Address.city is indexed
public Address getAddress() {
return this.address;
}

/* Additional Getters &amp; Setters */

}
</code></pre>

<p>We created an Embeddable Address object and used it as a property in our Store object.</p>


<div class='bs-callout bs-callout-success'><p>Please note that Embeddable classes must be Serializable since they&rsquo;re transferred over the network.</p>
</div>











<p>It&rsquo;s possible to query a Store entity by an Address property in the following way:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
Query query = em.createQuery(&quot;SELECT store FROM com.gigaspaces.objects.Store store WHERE s.address.city = 'London'&quot;);
List&lt;Store&gt; result = (List&lt;Store&gt;) query.getResultList();
</code></pre>

<h1 id="one-to-one">One-to-one</h1>

<p>GigaSpaces JPA One-to-one relationship is very similar to an embedded relationship except for the fact that when querying
the owner entity it is possible to use an Inner Join.</p>

<p>As with Embeddable classes, owned entities in a relationship should always be Serializable since they are transferred over the network.</p>

<p>In the following example we show a One-to-one relationship between two entities, Order &amp; Invoice:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">@Entity
public class Order {
private Long id;
private Date date;
private Invoice invoice;

public Order() {
}

@Id
@SpaceId
public Long getId() {
return this.id;
}

public Date getDate() {
return this.date;
}

@OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
@SpaceIndex(path = &quot;sum&quot;, type = SpaceIndexType.EXTENDED) // Invoice.sum is indexed
public Invoice getInvoice() {
return this.invoice;
}

// Additional Getters &amp; Setters...

}

// An Invoice entity which is owned in the relationship and
// therefore should implement Serializable
@Entity
public class Invoice implements Serializable {
private Long id;
private Double sum;

public Invoice() {
}

@Id
@SpaceId
public Long getId() {
return this.id;
}

public Double getSum() {
return this.sum;
}

// Additional Getters &amp; Setters...

}
</code></pre>

<p>For One-to-one relationship we can use an Inner Join for querying:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
Query query = em.createQuery(&quot;SELECT order FROM com.gigaspaces.objects.Order order JOIN o.invoice invoice WHERE invoice.sum &gt; 499.99&quot;);
List&lt;Order&gt; orders = (List&lt;Order&gt;) query.getResultList();
</code></pre>


<div class='bs-callout bs-callout-success'><p>We defined an extended index on Invoice.sum and therefore the above query takes advantage of the defined index.</p>
</div>











<h1 id="one-to-many">One-to-many</h1>

<p>GigaSpaces JPA One-to-many relationship means that the owner of the relationship stores the owned entities in a collection within itself.</p>

<p>As with One-to-one, owned entities in a relationship should always be Serializable since they are transferred over the network.</p>

<p>Lets examine the following example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">// An Author entity which will be the owner of a relationship.
@Entity
public class Author {
private Integer id;
private String name;
private List&lt;Book&gt; books;

public Author() {
}

@Id @SpaceId
public Integer getId() {
return this.id;
}

@SpaceRouting // Routing is determined by the author's name
public String getName() {
return this.name;
}

@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
@SpaceIndex(path = &quot;[*].id&quot;) // Books are indexed by their id
public List&lt;Book&gt; getBooks() {
return this.books;
}

// Additional Getters &amp; Setters..

}

// A Book entity which is owned in a relationship
// Book shouuld implement Serializable since its transferred over the network
@Entity
public class Book implements Serializable {
private Integer id;
private String name;

public Book() {
}

@Id
@SpaceId
public Integer getId() {
}

public String getName() {
}

// Additional Getters &amp; Setters..

}
</code></pre>

<p>We can use a JPQL Inner Join for querying an Author by a specific Book id:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
Query query = em.createQuery(&quot;SELECT author FROM com.gigaspaces.objects.Author author JOIN author.books book WHERE book.id = 100&quot;);
Author result = (Author) query.getSingleResult();
</code></pre>


<div class='bs-callout bs-callout-success'><p>We defined an index on Book.id and therefore the above query takes advantage of the defined index.</p>
</div>











<h1 id="limitations">Limitations</h1>

<h3 id="working-with-embedded-entities-limitations">Working with embedded entities limitations</h3>

<p>When working with embedded entities its not possible to call JPA methods on owned entities.</p>

<h3 id="owned-many-to-many-relationship">Owned many-to-many relationship</h3>

<p>Owned many-to-many relationship is not supported since GigaSpaces data model doesn&rsquo;t permit it.
It is possible to implement such a relation by explicitly setting the Ids for each of the relationship participants.</p>

<h3 id="unowned-relationships">Unowned relationships</h3>

<p>Unowned relationships where each part of the relation is represented as a Data Type in space is not supported.</p>
