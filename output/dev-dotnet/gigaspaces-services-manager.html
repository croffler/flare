<h1 >Services Manager</h1>
<hr>


<p>When installing the Service Grid on a Microsoft Windows environment, many administrators prefer to setup the Service Grid as A <em>Windows Service</em>, which have several advantages over standard console applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>A service can be configured to start automatically when the machine boots, without any user logging in.</li>
<li>A service can be configured to run under predefined credentials, e.g. SYSTEM.</li>
<li>A service has no console/GUI which clutters up the desktop (and might be closed accidentally&hellip;).</li>
<li>Windows provides standard management console, command line and API to manage services, which makes managing services a common task for system administrators.</li>
</ul>

<p>This page explains how to install a Service Grid as a Windows Service and manage it.</p>

<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>

<p>The Windows Services management console lets users start/stop installed services and modify their properties, but does not support installing new services. This task is can be done via a command line, or during installation of an application.</p>

<p>Instead, GigaSpaces XAP.NET provides a supplementary tool called <strong>GigaSpaces Services Manager</strong> (located at the <code>bin</code> folder) which simplifies common administration tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install/uninstall Service instances of <code>Grid Service Agent</code> as you please.</li>
<li>Perform common operations directly from the tool, no need to switch to the Windows Console (e.g. Start, Stop, change startup type).</li>
<li>Side-by-side support for GigaSpaces Installations of different versions on the same machine.</li>
<li>Automatically creates a folder for new service instances, with an XML configuration and log files.</li>
<li>Create custom templates of different service grid configurations.</li>
</ul>

If you&rsquo;re using Windows Vista or later and UAC is turned on, it is recommended to use &lsquo;Run As Administrator&rsquo; (for more info see: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922708">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922708</a>)</p>
