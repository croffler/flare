<h1 >Timeout, Filters and Lease Manager</h1>
<hr>
<p>The <strong>General</strong> tab contains settings related to client and server timeout, and the <strong>Lease Manager</strong>.</p>

<div style="text-align:center"><p><img src="../../attachment_files/Space TimeoutFiltersLease Manager - GigaSpaces Browser.jpg" alt="Space TimeoutFiltersLease Manager - GigaSpaces Browser.jpg" /></p>

<div class='bs-callout bs-callout-success'>
<b style="">Tip</b><br>
<p>If your client application loses its connection to the server, you can follow a simple procedure to check whether the server erased any of your notify templates in the interim:</p>

<ol>
<li>For each notify template, write an Entry to the space that matches the template.</li>
<li>Verify that you receive a notification.</li>
</ol>

<p>If there is no notification, this means two things. First, while you were disconnected, new Entries matching the notify template entered the space. (You can try to find them; depending on their lease time, they may still exist.) Second, as a result, your notify template was erased.</p>
</div>











<p>The <strong>Space Filters</strong> option specifies whether filters should be enabled or disabled for this Space. Filters are hooks inside the GigaSpaces engine that enable integration with external systems and/or implementation of user-defined logic inside the Space. The <code>DefaultSecurityFilter</code> is part of every Space by default, and it controls user permissions for the Space. Click <strong>Edit</strong> to launch the Filter Management dialog, which allows you to add custom filters and to manage the behavior of the default and custom filters.</p>
